# Categorical function models

Write the function model as typed data and let the `triz` MCP server check it, instead of
drawing an informal diagram and reasoning over it by eye. The model is an open wiring diagram:
boxes (components) with typed input and output ports, joined by wires (TRIZ functions) that
carry one flow type and a rating. The checks are finite and deterministic, and they fail closed.

Schema: [function-model.schema.json](../schemas/function-model.schema.json). Worked models for a
bearing, a cached API read path, and a marketplace live in the repository's
`examples/function-models/`.

## What each piece means

| TRIZ artifact | In the model | Check | Lean statement (`theory/`) |
|---|---|---|---|
| Component, supersystem element | box with `role` and typed ports | — | — |
| Flow (substance, energy, data, money) | carrier with `layer` and `dimension` | — | — |
| Function, rated useful (normal / insufficient / excessive) or harmful | wire from an output port to an input port, one carrier, one `polarity` | `triz_function_model`: endpoints exist, out→in, carriers agree | — |
| Back-reaction, vicious circle | a cycle through a harmful or excessive function | strongly connected regions with one witness cycle per such function | `edge_on_cycle` |
| Trimming rules A/B/C | the system recovered from what remains (left Kan extension of the restriction) | `triz_trim`: carrier screen only | `Recoverable` stated, `recoverable_id`; not decided |
| Ideality comparison | componentwise order on cost vectors | profile per dimension; baseline vs concept with `compare_to` | `trim_lowers_cost`, `pareto_incomparable`, `pareto_not_total` |
| Physical contradiction, separation | gluing a parameter assignment over a finite base | `triz_separate`, or embedded `contradictions` | `exists_section_iff`, `glue_of_disjoint_regions`, `no_section_of_overlap`, `separated_iff_axis`, `separation_on_condition` |

Ratings follow the MATRIZ function definition. A function is useful or harmful. Only useful
functions have a performance level: normal, insufficient, or excessive. A back-reaction is
modelled as an ordinary wire in the reverse direction, so no separate "lens" flag is needed.

## Protocol

1. **Model.** List the boxes, the carriers with their units, and every function with its rating.
   Call `triz_function_model`. On `ok: false`, fix every listed error before going on; never
   reason over a model that does not type-check.
2. **Harm loops.** For each reported loop, name the causal mechanism and the evidence for every
   function in the witness cycle. A loop is a candidate to examine, not a finding. Useful-only
   feedback, such as a control loop, is not reported.
3. **Trim.** Call `triz_trim` with the boxes to remove. The output holds three things:
   - each orphaned function, which blocks the trim;
   - each absorber, ordered rule B (the object serves itself) and then rule C (another
     component, with supersystem resources last);
   - one trimming problem per absorber.

   Treat every trimming problem as a new problem to solve. Still generate at least three
   mechanisms (SKILL.md). Model the chosen concept and compare it with `compare_to`. A concept
   that drops a deliverable loses a function, whatever it saves.
4. **Separate.** For a physical contradiction, give each demand its admissible values and the
   cells where it applies on each axis. Use `space`, `time`, `condition`, `direction`, and
   `level`, which are MATRIZ's five separation types; `condition` is MATRIZ's "relation
   (conditions)". The status drives the route:
   - `compatible`: a value meets both demands, so this is not a physical contradiction. Choose
     that value.
   - `separated`: the listed axes separate the demands. Assign the parameter piecewise.
   - `irreducible`: the demands overlap on every axis. Refine an axis, try another system level,
     or escalate to ARIZ.

## Domain working translations

These are working translations, not isomorphisms. SKILL.md rule 4 and the "conflict between
people" decline condition still apply.

| Domain | Box | Carrier | Harmful or excessive function | Trimming example |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Physical | part, fluid, housing | force, heat, mass, momentum | friction heat, wear, expansion preload | remove the bearing and let the housing support the shaft |
| Software | service, buffer, gateway | request, bytes, rows | stale cache reads, lock contention, retry storms | remove a cache tier and let the service or gateway cache |
| Business | business unit, partner, customer segment | cash flow, listings, orders | excessive fees, price pass-through | remove an intermediary and let a remaining party perform its function |

A business loop says only that a closed chain of disadvantages exists in the model. Whether
that chain is moral hazard, a margin squeeze, or nothing at all is an empirical question, for
example cohort churn against fee changes. Name it only from that evidence.

## What is not claimed

- Nothing computes a Kan extension, an optic or lens, sheaf cohomology, a Grothendieck
  fibration, or a double-pushout rewrite. The categorical names identify the structure each
  check is a necessary condition of. Of those statements, only the trimming one is stated in
  Lean, and it is not decided.
- A carrier match is necessary for an absorber, not sufficient. Each absorber's added cost and
  its new harms are not modelled.
- `harmLoops` is exhaustive for the model as written. It cannot find a back-reaction the model
  omits.
- A scalar ideality is produced only from explicit `weights` covering every cost dimension and
  `harmful`. Otherwise, costs are reported per dimension and never summed.
- Not adopted: 9-windows as fibrations, evolution trends as graph rewriting, and the 40
  principles as diagram transformations. The analogies are recorded in
  [sources.md](sources.md); none is implemented.
