# Non-vacuity witnesses

A lemma whose hypotheses can never hold together proves nothing. For each `Wiring` lemma in
`CategoricalTriz`, this module gives:

- a concrete diagram on which all its hypotheses hold while a wire survives, so the lemma is not
  vacuous;
- a counterexample showing that each hypothesis is needed: drop it, and the conclusion fails.

The examples are checked by `lake build --wfail`, so CI keeps them in step with the lemmas.

  simp [d3]

/-! ## `typed_delete`

Deleting box 2 meets the no-dangling condition and keeps the wire. Deleting box 1, the wire's
target, without deleting the wire breaks typing: `hd` is needed. -/

example : (d3.delete {2} ∅).Typed ∧ () ∈ (d3.delete {2} ∅).wires :=
  ⟨d3.typed_delete d3_typed (by intro w _ _; simp [d3]), by simp [Wiring.delete, d3]⟩

example : ¬ (d3.delete {1} ∅).Typed := by
  intro h
  have := (h () (by simp [Wiring.delete, d3])).2.1
  simp [Wiring.delete, d3] at this

/-! ## `typed_reroute`

Re-attaching the wire to box 2's same-carrier output keeps typing. Re-attaching it to box 1,
which has no output (`hq` fails), or to box 2 when box 2 is absent (`ha` fails), does not. -/

example : (d3.reroute () 2 ()).Typed := d3.typed_reroute d3_typed (by simp [d3]) (by simp [d3])

example : ¬ (d3.reroute () 1 ()).Typed := by
  intro h
  have := (h () (by simp [Wiring.reroute, d3])).2.2.1
  simp [Wiring.reroute, d3] at this

/-- `d3` without box 2: still typed, but the absorber is gone. -/
def d3b : Wiring (Fin 3) Unit Unit Unit := { d3 with boxes := {0, 1} }

example : d3b.Typed := by intro w _; simp [d3b, d3]

example : ¬ (d3b.reroute () 2 ()).Typed := by
  intro h
  have := (h () (by simp [Wiring.reroute, d3b, d3])).1
  simp [Wiring.reroute, d3b, d3] at this

/-! ## `typed_glue`

Gluing a well-typed wire 2 → 1 keeps typing and the new wire is present. Gluing a wire from
box 1, which has no output, does not: `hF` is needed. -/

/-- One existing wire 0 → 1 (`false`), and a candidate wire `true` from box `s` to box 1. -/
def dg (s : Fin 3) : Wiring (Fin 3) Unit Bool Unit where
  boxes := Set.univ
  wires := {false}
  src w := if w then (s, ()) else (0, ())
  tgt _ := (1, ())
  carrier _ := ()
  out b _ := if b = 0 ∨ b = 2 then some () else none
  inp b _ := if b = 1 then some () else none

example : ((dg 2).glue ∅ {true}).Typed ∧ true ∈ ((dg 2).glue ∅ {true}).wires :=
  ⟨(dg 2).typed_glue (by intro w hw; simp [dg] at hw ⊢; simp [hw]) (by intro w hw; simp [dg] at hw ⊢; simp [hw]),
   by simp [Wiring.glue, dg]⟩

example : ¬ ((dg 1).glue ∅ {true}).Typed := by
  intro h
  have := (h true (by simp [Wiring.glue, dg])).2.2.1
  simp [Wiring.glue, dg] at this

/-! ## `typed_restrict`, `restrict_of_subset`

Zooming into boxes {0, 1} keeps the wire and its typing. Without `A' ⊆ A`, zooming into {0} and
then {0, 1} is not zooming into {0, 1}. -/

example : (d3.restrict {0, 1}).Typed ∧ () ∈ (d3.restrict {0, 1}).wires :=
  ⟨d3.typed_restrict d3_typed _, by simp [Wiring.restrict, d3]⟩

example : (d3.restrict {0}).restrict {0, 1} ≠ d3.restrict {0, 1} := by
  intro h
  have := congrArg (fun d => (1 : Fin 3) ∈ d.boxes) h
  simp [Wiring.restrict, d3] at this

/-! ## `typed_rename`

The lemma applies to a non-trivial relabelling: swapping the wire's source and target boxes. -/

example : (d3.rename (Equiv.swap 0 1) (fun _ => Equiv.refl _) (Equiv.refl _) (Equiv.refl _)).Typed :=
  (d3.typed_rename _ _ _ _).mpr d3_typed

/-! ## `restrict_eq_self`, `supportedOn`, `typedOn`

`d3b` (boxes {0, 1}, wire 0 → 1) is typed and supported on {0, 1}, so it is a typed section of
the level presheaf there. Dropping `hA`: `d3` has box 2 outside {0, 1}. Dropping `h`: with box 0
absent, the wire leaves the boxes and restriction removes it. -/

theorem d3b_typed : d3b.Typed := by intro w _; simp [d3b, d3]

example : d3b.restrict {0, 1} = d3b ∧ () ∈ d3b.wires :=
  ⟨d3b.restrict_eq_self d3b_typed le_rfl, by simp [d3b, d3]⟩

example : (⟨d3b, d3b.restrict_eq_self d3b_typed le_rfl⟩ :
    (Wiring.supportedOn (Fin 3) Unit Unit Unit).obj (op {0, 1})) ∈
      (Wiring.typedOn (Fin 3) Unit Unit Unit).obj (op {0, 1}) :=
  d3b_typed

example : d3.restrict {0, 1} ≠ d3 := by
  intro h
  have := congrArg (fun d => (2 : Fin 3) ∈ d.boxes) h
  simp [Wiring.restrict, d3] at this

/-- `d3` without box 0: the wire's source is missing, so the diagram is not typed. -/
def d3u : Wiring (Fin 3) Unit Unit Unit := { d3 with boxes := {1} }

example : ¬ d3u.Typed ∧ d3u.boxes ⊆ {1} ∧ d3u.restrict {1} ≠ d3u := by
  refine ⟨fun h => ?_, le_rfl, fun h => ?_⟩
  · have := (h () (by simp [d3u, d3])).1
    simp [d3u, d3] at this
  · have := congrArg (fun d => () ∈ d.wires) h
    simp [Wiring.restrict, d3u, d3] at this

/-! ## `restrict_rewrite`, `restrict_rewrite_of_inside`, `boundary_rewrite`

Adding the wire `true` (box `s` → box 1) to `dg s`, and zooming into {0, 1}:

- from box 0 the addition is inside {0, 1}: the step applies verbatim and the wire survives;
- from box 2 it crosses the boundary: verbatim application keeps a wire the restriction drops
  (`hF` is needed), and the wire lands in the boundary instead;
- adding box 2 to a diagram on {0, 1} is outside: verbatim application keeps it (`hN` is needed).

`restrict_rewrite` has no hypothesis; these show its restricted rule is not the rule. -/

/-- Glue the wire `true`. -/
def addWire : Wiring.Rule (Fin 3) Bool := ⟨∅, ∅, ∅, {true}⟩

example : ((dg 0).rewrite addWire).restrict {0, 1} = ((dg 0).restrict {0, 1}).rewrite addWire ∧
    true ∈ (((dg 0).rewrite addWire).restrict {0, 1}).wires :=
  ⟨(dg 0).restrict_rewrite_of_inside (by simp [addWire])
      (by intro w hw; simp [addWire] at hw; simp [hw, dg]),
   by simp [Wiring.rewrite, Wiring.restrict, Wiring.glue, Wiring.delete, addWire, dg]⟩

example : ((dg 2).rewrite addWire).restrict {0, 1} ≠ ((dg 2).restrict {0, 1}).rewrite addWire := by
  intro h
  have := congrArg (fun d => true ∈ d.wires) h
  simp [Wiring.rewrite, Wiring.restrict, Wiring.glue, Wiring.delete, addWire, dg] at this

example : true ∈ ((dg 2).rewrite addWire).boundary {0, 1} := by
  rw [Wiring.boundary_rewrite]
  simp [addWire, dg]

/-- Glue box 2. -/
def addBox : Wiring.Rule (Fin 3) Bool := ⟨∅, ∅, {2}, ∅⟩

example : (({ dg 0 with boxes := {0, 1} } : Wiring (Fin 3) Unit Bool Unit).rewrite addBox).restrict {0, 1} ≠
    (({ dg 0 with boxes := {0, 1} } : Wiring (Fin 3) Unit Bool Unit).restrict {0, 1}).rewrite addBox := by
  intro h
  have := congrArg (fun d => (2 : Fin 3) ∈ d.boxes) h
  simp [Wiring.rewrite, Wiring.restrict, Wiring.glue, Wiring.delete, addBox] at this

/-! Re-attaching a wire across the boundary does not commute with restriction: `reroute` moves an
endpoint, which a delete/glue step never does. The kernel reads a wire re-added under the same id
with a new endpoint as a deleted wire and a glued one. -/

example : (d3.reroute () 2 ()).restrict {0, 1} ≠ (d3.restrict {0, 1}).reroute () 2 () := by
  intro h
  have := congrArg (fun d => () ∈ d.wires) h
  simp [Wiring.reroute, Wiring.restrict, d3] at this

/-! ## `restrictionGrid`

The window at (present, {0, 1}) seen from (past, all boxes) is the past diagram stepped, then
restricted. -/

example : ((Wiring.restrictionGrid (P := Unit) (C := Unit) addWire addWire).map
      (X := ((0 : Fin 3), op (Set.univ : Set (Fin 3)))) (Y := ((1 : Fin 3), op ({0, 1} : Set (Fin 3))))
      (homOfLE (by decide), (homOfLE (Set.subset_univ _)).op)
      ⟨dg 2, (dg 2).restrict_univ⟩).1 = ((dg 2).rewrite addWire).restrict {0, 1} := by
  change (((dg 2).rewrite addWire).restrict Set.univ).restrict {0, 1} = _
  rw [Wiring.restrict_restrict, Set.univ_inter]

/-! ## Behaviour

Reserved for the witnesses of the behaviour lemmas, added with them. -/
