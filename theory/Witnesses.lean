# Non-vacuity witnesses

A lemma whose hypotheses can never hold together proves nothing. For each `Wiring` lemma in
`CategoricalTriz`, this module gives:

- a concrete diagram on which all its hypotheses hold while a wire survives, so the lemma is not
  vacuous;
- a counterexample showing that each hypothesis is needed: drop it, and the conclusion fails.

The examples are checked by `lake build --wfail`, so CI keeps them in step with the lemmas.

/-! ## `typed_delete`

Deleting box 2 meets the no-dangling condition and keeps the wire. Deleting box 1, the wire's
target, without deleting the wire breaks typing: `hd` is needed. -/

example : (d3.delete {2} ∅).Typed ∧ () ∈ (d3.delete {2} ∅).wires :=
  ⟨d3.typed_delete d3_typed (by intro w _ _; simp [d3]), by simp [Wiring.delete, d3]⟩

  intro h
  have := (h () (by simp [Wiring.delete, d3])).2.1
  simp [Wiring.delete, d3] at this

/-! ## `typed_reroute`

Re-attaching the wire to box 2's same-carrier output keeps typing. Re-attaching it to box 1,
which has no output (`hq` fails), or to box 2 when box 2 is absent (`ha` fails), does not. -/

example : (d3.reroute () 2 ()).Typed := d3.typed_reroute d3_typed (by simp [d3]) (by simp [d3])

example : ¬ (d3.reroute () 1 ()).Typed := by
  intro h
  have := (h () (by simp [Wiring.reroute, d3])).2.2.1
  simp [Wiring.reroute, d3] at this

/-- `d3` without box 2: still typed, but the absorber is gone. -/
def d3b : Wiring (Fin 3) Unit Unit Unit := { d3 with boxes := {0, 1} }

example : d3b.Typed := by intro w _; simp [d3b, d3]

  intro h
  have := (h () (by simp [Wiring.reroute, d3b, d3])).1
  simp [Wiring.reroute, d3b, d3] at this

/-! ## `typed_glue`

Gluing a well-typed wire 2 → 1 keeps typing and the new wire is present. Gluing a wire from
box 1, which has no output, does not: `hF` is needed. -/

/-- One existing wire 0 → 1 (`false`), and a candidate wire `true` from box `s` to box 1. -/
def dg (s : Fin 3) : Wiring (Fin 3) Unit Bool Unit where
  boxes := Set.univ
  wires := {false}
  src w := if w then (s, ()) else (0, ())
  tgt _ := (1, ())
  carrier _ := ()
  out b _ := if b = 0 ∨ b = 2 then some () else none
  inp b _ := if b = 1 then some () else none

example : ((dg 2).glue ∅ {true}).Typed ∧ true ∈ ((dg 2).glue ∅ {true}).wires :=
  ⟨(dg 2).typed_glue (by intro w hw; simp [dg] at hw ⊢; simp [hw]) (by intro w hw; simp [dg] at hw ⊢; simp [hw]),
   by simp [Wiring.glue, dg]⟩

example : ¬ ((dg 1).glue ∅ {true}).Typed := by
  intro h
  have := (h true (by simp [Wiring.glue, dg])).2.2.1
  simp [Wiring.glue, dg] at this

/-! ## `typed_restrict`, `restrict_of_subset`

Zooming into boxes {0, 1} keeps the wire and its typing. Without `A' ⊆ A`, zooming into {0} and
then {0, 1} is not zooming into {0, 1}. -/

example : (d3.restrict {0, 1}).Typed ∧ () ∈ (d3.restrict {0, 1}).wires :=
  ⟨d3.typed_restrict d3_typed _, by simp [Wiring.restrict, d3]⟩

example : (d3.restrict {0}).restrict {0, 1} ≠ d3.restrict {0, 1} := by
  intro h
  have := congrArg (fun d => (1 : Fin 3) ∈ d.boxes) h
  simp [Wiring.restrict, d3] at this

/-! ## `typed_rename`

The lemma applies to a non-trivial relabelling: swapping the wire's source and target boxes. -/

example : (d3.rename (Equiv.swap 0 1) (fun _ => Equiv.refl _) (Equiv.refl _) (Equiv.refl _)).Typed :=
  (d3.typed_rename _ _ _ _).mpr d3_typed

/-! ## Behaviour

Reserved for the witnesses of the behaviour lemmas, added with them. -/
